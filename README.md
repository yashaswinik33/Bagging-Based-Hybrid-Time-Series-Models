**Author:** Yashaswini K

##  Description  

This project implements and compares different time series forecasting approaches for **12 Indian economic indicators**.  

### Models considered:  

1. **Base Models** â€“ individual forecasting models:  
   - SARIMA  
   - ETS  
   - STL + SARIMA  
   - STL + ETS  
   - NNAR  
   - MLP  

2. **Hybrid Models** â€“ parallel hybrid forecasting using different weighting methods:  
   - Simple Average (SA) â†’ **H-SM**  
   - Trimmed Mean (TM) â†’ **H-TM**  
   - Weighted Mean (WM) â†’ **H-WM**  
   - Simple Weighted Average Method (SWAM) â†’ **H-SWAM**  
   - Ordinary Least Squares for Minimum Error â†’ **H-OLSME**  
   - Variance-Covariance Method â†’ **H-VarCov**  

3. **Bagged Models** â€“ bootstrap aggregation (bagging) applied to base models to reduce variance and improve forecast stability.  

### Outputs generated:  
- **Forecast predictions**  
- **Evaluation metrics**: RMSE and MAE

## Aim & Objectives  

**Aim:**  
To develop a **bagging-based hybrid time series model** to forecast Indian economic indicators with better forecasting capacity than the existing hybrid model.  

**Objectives:**  
- To examine the performance of selected base models in forecasting Indian economic indicators.  
- To examine the performance of parallel hybrid models with various weighting methods.  
- To examine the performance of bagged base models.  
- To examine the performance of bagging-based hybrid models with different weighting methods.
