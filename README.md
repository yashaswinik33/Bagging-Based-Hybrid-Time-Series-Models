##  Description  

This project implements and compares different time series forecasting approaches for **12 Indian economic indicators**:  

1. **Base Models** â€“ individual forecasting models (SARIMA, ETS, STL+SARIMA, STL+ETS, NNAR, MLP).  
2. **Hybrid Models** â€“ parallel hybrid forecasting with various weighting methods (Simple Mean, Trimmed Mean, Weighted Mean, SWAM, OLS-based, and Variance-Covariance weighting).  
3. **Bagged Models** â€“ bootstrap aggregation applied to base models to reduce variance and improve forecast stability.  

The project outputs:  
- **Forecast predictions**  
- **Evaluation metrics**: RMSE and MAE

##  Aim & Objectives  

**Aim:**  
To develop a **bagging-based hybrid time series model** to forecast Indian economic indicators with better forecasting capacity than the existing hybrid model.  

**Objectives:**  
- To examine the performance of selected base models in forecasting Indian economic indicators.  
- To examine the performance of parallel hybrid models with various weighting methods.  
- To examine the performance of bagged base models.  
- To examine the performance of bagging-based hybrid models with different weighting methods.
